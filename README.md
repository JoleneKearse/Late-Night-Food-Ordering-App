I got the inspiration from **[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)**'s **Solo Project** to cap off their **Frontend Developer Career Path**'s **Module 5: Essential JavaScript**.

## My Motivation

It sounded cool, but I'm not really a hamburger kind of girl. 🍔 So I got to thinking... _'What kind of food would make me super excited?'_ 🤔

Well, I miss tons of things from living in China for 15 years... Especially stopping for a chill late night dinner after teaching until 9 p.m., then commuting 1 hour plus back to my neighbourhood. 😅

China has restaurants everywhere and a vibrant late night food scene. Even food stalls on the side of streets open until 5 in the morning!

But what about those times you just want to head home with tasty treats? 🥡

In comes my app! 📱 When you're close to home, simply place your order, get into your comfies, and have your late night snack brought to your door!

## MVP

I had already thrown out the **design spec**, but there were certain things I felt were push haves:

- Rendering the **menu** 🍜 with JavaScript including the name, description, price and an Add button.
- Working Add ➕ buttons
- Bill information that would pop up only when something was added
- Ability to remove ➖ items when desired
- Allowing users to order multiples of items
- Total price to be displayed
- Ability to Place Order
- Payment Modal

## Design Choices

Of course this was the most difficult part! 🤣 First up I choose the food images.

I liked how the **Scrimba** design used emojis, but a search didn't yield the variety I wanted...

I considered using **jpg**'s, but decided I wanted a cleaner UI...

So I searched for icons, and, wow, did [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) really deliver! They had a great free collection and you could even use **CDN**'s!

Then I went on an exhaustive search for Asian-looking Google Fonts. I kept ending up with Chinese-language ones! 🤣 But I really liked **[Faster One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Faster+One?query=faster+one)** for the **title** as it suggested speed to me.

I also went through multiple **header** images. One where I took my **accent colour** from a Chinese lantern, but I ultimately ended up going with with this cool Chinese roof image.

## My Process

After cracking the **design process**, which I absolutely love ❤️, but can certainly take up time, I was ready to go! 🏎️

1. ### Data

After, of course, setting up the HTML, this was my first stop. I had to consider which menu items to include. Then which properties I'd add.

![data.js file with Menu Array showing which properties and keys I chose, including name, id, description, price, image, and numberOrdered]()

> The numberOrdered property came later, when I considered the logic behind allowing a customer to order more than one of a menu item.

2. ### Data Attributes
